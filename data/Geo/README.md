#GeoQuery

The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/nldata/geoquery.html). This is a set of geography questions, originally paired with a database that executed the produced logic forms to produce an answer. The dataset included here uses the train-test split as well as the lambda-calculus representation from the following paper:

L. S. Zettlemoyer and M. Collins. 2005. Learning to map sentences to logical form: Structured classification with probabilistic categorial grammars. In Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI), pages 658â€“666.

This data was acquired from the [Cornell Semantic Parsing Framework repository](https://bitbucket.org/yoavartzi/spf) and then preprocessed into a form this parser can handle.
